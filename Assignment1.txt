## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Answer- Python is a general purpose language because it can be used to create a different kind of variety codes and it is not specialized for any specific problems and since it is easily understandable/readable for Humans we call it high level language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Answer- Python is called as dynamically typrd language because python don't have any prblem if we dont declare the type of variable. Overall in python the type of variable is determined only during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Answer- Pros:
			Beginner-friendly, easy to learn
			Python enhances productivity
			Python has vast collection of libraries
			Free & Open Source, large community
			Portable
			Interpreted 
			
		Cons:
			Speed limitation
			Runtime errors
			Consumes lot of memory space
			Not so strong with mobile computing

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Answer- Web Development, Data Science, OS Development, Gaming, Scientific Programming.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Answer- Variables are basically names given to memory location.

		Below examples to declare variables-
		
		int_var = 45 
		float_var = 99.99
		string_var = 'India is going to win T20 World Cup 2022'

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Answer- username = input("Enter Name")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Answer- String

Q8. What is type casting?

Answer- The conversion of one data type into the other data type is knowns as type casting.
		
		int_var = int_var + 10  
		casted_int_var = float(int_var)

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Answer- Yes we can take multiple input using single input() function.
		We can use split method to achieve this.
		e.g. a,b,c = input("Enter three values: ").split()

Q10. What are keywords?

Answer- Python Keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.
		e.g. if, else, elseif, True, False, and, or, break............. etc.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Answer- No, Python keywords holds special meaning in Python Programming and it define the syntax of the coding. So, we can't use them as variable.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Answer- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of the code line. In Python Indentation play a very important role bacuase it indicate the blocks of code/statement.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Answer- We can use the print statement to get the required output.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Answer- Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computations.

		-Numerical Operators
		-Assignment Operators
		-Comparison Operators
		-Logical Operators etc.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

Answer- /	- Division - It will do the division and provide a float vale as output.
		//	- Floor Division - It will do the division operation and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Answer-	print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Answer- num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
		if (num % 2) == 0:
			print ("Entered number is even")
		else:
			print("Entered number is odd")
		

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Answer- AND, NOT, OR are boolean operators of Python.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Answer- 1 or 0 = 1
		0 and 0 = 0
		True and False and True = False
		1 or 0 or 0 = 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Answer- Python supports the Mathematical logical conditions -
		Eqauls - a==b
		Not Equal - a != b
		Less than - a < b
		Greater than - a > b
		Less than or equal to - a <= b
		Greater than or equal to - a >= b
		
		All above conditions we can use with Python conditional decision making statements like if, else, else if etc.
		
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Answer- If, elif, else keywords statements is used in python for decision making. Program will evaluate test expression and will execue the statements based on conditions for multiple expressions.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Answer- age = int(input("Hi!, What's your Age: "))
		if (age >=18 ):
			print ("I can vote")
		if (age < 18 ):
			print ("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Answer- numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
		sum = 0
		for values in numbers:
			if (values%2)==0:
				sum=sum+values
		print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Answer- num1,num2,num3 = input("Enter three numbers: ").split()
		if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
			larg=num1
		elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
			larg=num2
		else:
			larg=num3
		print("The Largest Number is",larg)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Answer-
